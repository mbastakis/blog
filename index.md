Welcome to My Blog

# Purpose

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This blog serves as a personal space where I document my technical experiences, discoveries, and insights—primarily in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, Software Development, and Embedded Systems. While my primary goal is to keep track of my learnings and solutions, I hope these posts can also serve as a valuable resource for others facing similar challenges.

Expect deep dives into CI/CD, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, automation, software architecture, and more. Whether you're an engineer, developer, or tech enthusiast, I hope you find something useful here!

# 👨‍💻 About Me
